Miscellaneous Java projects

1. ConstrainedTopoSort - determines whether an arbitrary directed graph has a valid topological sort in which some vertex, x, comes before some other vertex, y

2. GenericBST - an implementation of a binary search tree using generics

3. RunLikeHell - uses dynamic programming to solve the following problem: given an arbitary array of positive integers, find the sequence of indices that results in the largest sum when restricted from choosing any two adjacent indices 

4. SkipList - a stochastic data structure that uses probability theory to simplify the process of making a linked list O(log(n)) searchable

5. SneakyKnights - determines whether any knights can attack one another in a given a list of coordinate strings on an arbitrarily large square chess board in O(n) time 

6. SneakyQueens - same as SneakyKnights but using Queens

7. TopolALLgical - uese backtracking to generate all valid topological sorts for an abitrary directed graph
